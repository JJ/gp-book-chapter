		 antonyms ``parsimony'', ``Minimum Description Length''
		 (MDL) and ``Occam's razor''. Comparison with runs with
		 and without fitness selection pressure shows the
		 tendency for solutions to grow in size is caused by
		 fitness based selection. We argue that such growth is
		 inherent in using a fixed evaluation function with a
		 discrete but variable length representation. Since with
		 simple static evaluation search converges to mainly
		 finding trial solutions with the same fitness as
		 existing trial solutions. In general variable length
		 allows many more long representations of a given
		 solution than short ones of the same solution. Thus
		 with an unbiased random search we expect longer
		 representations to occur more often and so
		 representation length tends to increase. I.e. fitness

                 (bloat) in genetic programming (GP). Currently there
                 are three hypothesised causes of code growth in GP:

                 single node mutations increase code growth in evolving

                 hypothesis is correct. We also show a negative

                 during crossover and the resulting change in fitness,
                 but a much weaker correlation for added branches. These

                 grow rapidly and relatively independent of fitness, a
                 serious flaw which has received considerable attention
                 in the genetic programming literature. Much of this
                 literature has implicated introns, subtree structures
                 with no effect on the an individual's fitness
                 assessment. The propagation of inviable code, a certain
                 kind of intron, has been especially linked to tree
                 growth. However this paper presents evidence which
                 shows that denying inviable code the opportunity to
                 propagate actually increases tree growth. The paper
                 argues that rather than causing tree growth, a rise in
                 inviable code is in fact an expected result of tree
                 growth. Lastly, this paper proposes a more general
                 theory of growth for which introns are merely a

                 two other parameters. We test this approach on three
